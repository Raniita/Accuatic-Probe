# Shell Scripts

In this folder we can find the shell scripts that 'should' simplify the usability of the software.

## Folder structure

Should replicate this folder structure in order to get working the shell scripts.

* root folder (example: Ocean-CTD)
    - source
        * Ocean-CTD (this repository, just clone inside this folder (no folder inside, just all the files))
        * FORCE_UPDATE.cmd
        * UPDATE.cmd
    - INT_TEST.cmd
    - LAB.cmd
    - PERFIL.cmd
    - SIMULADOR.cmd
